## ✅ Problem Statement Addressed

### 1. Camera Crash Issue ✅
**Problem**: Camera functionality was causing the app to crash when attempting to take pictures.

**Root Cause**: Nullable Uri being passed to camera launcher without null safety checks.

**Solution**: 
- Created non-null Uri variable before launching camera
- Added cache directory to FileProvider configuration
- Improved error handling

**Files Modified**:
- `app/src/main/java/com/expenses/app/ui/screens/AddReceiptScreen.kt`
- `app/src/main/res/xml/file_paths.xml`

### 2. Receipt Deletion Feature ✅
**Problem**: No way for users to delete receipts if wrong image is imported.

**Solution**: 
- Added delete button with trash icon in EditReceiptScreen
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion
- Automatic cleanup of associated image files
- Proper error handling and user feedback

**Files Modified**:
- `app/src/main/java/com/expenses/app/ui/screens/EditReceiptScreen.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/expenses/app/ui/ReceiptViewModel.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/expenses/app/MainActivity.kt`

### 3. OneDrive Integration ✅
**Problem**: Need to upload receipts to OneDrive with category-based organization.

**Requirements**:
- Fuel receipts → `Receipts/Fuel/` folder
- Other receipts → `Receipts/Other/` folder
- Manual upload capability

**Solution**: 
- Complete OneDrive integration using Microsoft Graph API
- Settings screen for configuration
- Upload button in receipt edit screen
- Automatic status tracking (EXPORTED/FAILED)
- Category-based folder routing (case-insensitive)

**Files Created**:
- `app/src/main/java/com/expenses/app/util/OneDriveService.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/expenses/app/ui/screens/SettingsScreen.kt`

**Files Modified**:
- `app/build.gradle.kts` (added dependencies)
- `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` (added INTERNET permission)
- `app/src/main/java/com/expenses/app/ui/Navigation.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/expenses/app/ui/ReceiptViewModel.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/expenses/app/ui/screens/EditReceiptScreen.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/expenses/app/ui/screens/HomeScreen.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/expenses/app/MainActivity.kt`

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Service Layer**: `OneDriveService` handles all API communication
- **ViewModel Layer**: Coordinates upload process and status tracking
- **UI Layer**: Settings screen for config, upload button in edit screen
- **Data Layer**: Receipt status updates (EXPORTED/FAILED)

### Dependencies Added
```kotlin
// Microsoft Graph SDK for OneDrive
implementation("com.microsoft.graph:microsoft-graph:6.7.0")
implementation("com.microsoft.identity.client:msal:5.0.0")

// HTTP Client
implementation("com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.12.0")
```

### Key Features
1. **Category-Based Routing**: Automatic folder selection based on receipt category
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and user feedback
3. **Status Tracking**: Receipt export status updated automatically
4. **File Naming**: Consistent naming: `DD.MM.YYYY - MERCHANT - TOTAL.jpg`
5. **Security**: Password-masked token input, thread-safe configuration
6. **Performance**: Shared OkHttpClient, async operations with coroutines

## 🔒 Security Enhancements

### Implemented
✅ Thread-safe config with `@Volatile` annotation
✅ Removed all `!!` operators to prevent NPEs
✅ Password masking for access token input
✅ Token validation (minimum 20 characters)
✅ Temp file cleanup after uploads
✅ Proper URI scheme validation
✅ HTTPS-only communication
✅ FileProvider for secure file sharing

### Production Recommendations
- Implement OAuth2 flow with MSAL
- Store tokens in Android Keystore
- Add database encryption with SQLCipher
- Enable ProGuard for code obfuscation
- Implement certificate pinning
